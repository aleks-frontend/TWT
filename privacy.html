				<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
				<!-- Dummy Content for the Privacy Policy -->
				<p>John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliate companies (collectively, &#8220;Wiley,&#8221; &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; or &#8220;our&#8221;) recognize the importance of protecting the information collected from users in the operation of its services, and take reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity and privacy of any information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting your information to Wiley you consent to the practices described in this policy. If you are less than 18 years of age, then you must first seek the consent of your parent or guardian prior to submitting any personal information.</p>
				<p>Wiley will seek to ensure that any identifiable personal information it collects during the registration and purchasing processes will be adequate, relevant and not excessive for purposes of operating its websites or any of its services and it will be kept accurate and up-to-date based on the information provided.</p>
				<h2>How We Collect Information</h2>
				<p>Wiley collects information from you in two ways: directly from your input and automatically through Wiley&#8217;s website technologies.</p>
				<h2>Information You Provide</h2>

				</ul>
				<p>In order to access certain content and to make use of additional functionality and features of Wiley&#8217;s websites and services, we may ask you to register for an account by completing and submitting a registration form, which may request additional information.</p>
				<p>If you choose to register and sign in by using a third party account (such as your Facebook account), the authentication of your login is handled by the third party. Wiley will collect your name, email address and any other information about your third party account that you agree to share with us at the time you give permission for your Wiley account to be linked to your third party account.</p>
				<h2>Information We Receive From Other Sources</h2>
				<p>Wiley may hold information about you if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we provide. We  also work closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.</p>
				<h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
				<p>Wiley may use your personal information in the following ways:</p>
				<ul class="unIndentedList">
				<li>To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us and to provide you with information about products and services that you request from us;</li>
				<li>To send you periodic catalogues from Wiley, if you have consented to receive them;</li>
				<li>To provide you with information about other products, events and services we offer that are similar to those you have already purchased or inquired about or other communications containing information about new products and services or upcoming events of ours, our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties such as societies and sponsors, if you have consented to receive this information;</li>
				<li>For internal business and research purposes and to help enhance, evaluate and develop our websites, products and services and to develop new products and services;</li>
				<li>To notify you about changes or updates to our websites;</li>
				<li>To notify you about changes or updates to our products and services if you have consented to receive this information;</li>
				<li>To respond to your requests, inquiries, comments or concerns;</li>
				<li>To administer our services and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, statistical and survey purposes;</li>

				<li>As part of our efforts to keep our site safe and secure;</li>
				<li>For any other purpose that we may notify you of from time to time, providing that we have sought your consent.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
				<p>Wiley will not disclose your personal information to any third party except as follows:</p>
				<ul class="unIndentedList">
				<li>Where necessary in connection with services provided by intermediaries, who are required to comply with this policy. These service providers provide us with a wide range of office, administrative, information technology, production and business management services;</li>
				<li>If you voluntarily provide information in response to an advertisement, with the third party serving the advertisement;</li>
				<li>In order to comply with the law or requests by law enforcement agencies, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property or safety of our services, users or others; and</li>
				<li>In the event that all or substantially all of the business or assets of Wiley relating to this service are sold or otherwise assigned to another entity, personally identifiable information may be transferred to such entity; and</li>
				<li>Where necessary in connection with providing publishing services on behalf of third parties, such as institutions and societies, providing we have your consent.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Wiley may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including &#8220;page views&#8221; on this website and the products therein) and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal your identity or personal information.</p>
				<h2>Cross Border Transfers</h2>
				<p>Wiley may transfer your personal information outside of your country of residence for the following reasons:</p>
				<ul class="unIndentedList">
				<li>In order to process your transactions. This may occur on servers in countries other than the country where you live. Wiley has servers and major office locations in several countries, in particular in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, Brazil, India and Australia and has service providers located in India and the Philippines amongst other countries. Such processing may include, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.</li>
				<li>In order to satisfy global reporting requirements. Wiley may be required to provide your personal information to Wiley affiliates in other countries.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and all applicable data protection laws.</p>
				<p>Safe Harbour: Wiley complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

				<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
